#### About:

##### Application has basic authentication

* Authorized user can shorten url at the index page - /;
* Authorized user can view his own generated valid[1] urls at /dashboard/;

##### Url shortener
* Shot url is generated by converting number to a higher base. Currently it is set to Base62 - [0-9], [a-z], [A-Z];
* Number for short url is record's ID. Currently number is set between 100000 - ZZZZZZ (BASE62) to have quite short url with around 31 milliard available combinations;
* Record's id is generated as pseudo random number by using LCG algorithm and previous records ID as a seed. Ref: [Wiki LCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator);
